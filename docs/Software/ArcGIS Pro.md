Getting to know ArcGIS Pro
 
In lab this week you are going to complete a tutorial created by ESRI that is designed to introduce people to ArcPro for the first time. For you it will be a refresher from last semester I like this tutorial because not only does it walk you gently through the software, it also demonstrates what a GIS is capable of. You will work with the different forms of data we discussed in lecture. This is also related to the same content and material I covered in lecture.
Lab Instructions
Open the Tutorial
●	Let’s start by opening the tutorial. https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/get-started-with-arcgis-pro/ 
o	Note the name for this tutorial may have changed to ‘Predict Deforestation in the Amazon Rain Forest’
●	With that link open, sign in using your enterprise account login.
●	At this point you are asked to download the data from the Get Started with ArcGIS Pro Group.
o	Click on the link and attempt to download the data into a folder you created in the C:\ temp folder.
o	Note: If you cannot do this, I have already downloaded the data for you and placed it into the class data folder.
▪	T:\AT319\AT319ClassData\GetStartedWithArcPro
Arc Pro
Note: Make your answers in purple. Also label all screen shots as figures and provide a figure caption. Points will be deducted for any images without a figure label and caption.
●	After you open the software, follow the tutorial instructions, but also answer the questions below that related to the section in the tutorial
●	Section: Find the study area
o	What is a basemap? How might different basemaps relate to different ways of examining the data?
▪	A basemap provides reference information such as national boundaries and water bodies. Different referenced information on a custom basemap may be beneficial to different uses of GIS. 
o	 How might the locate function help in UAS mission planning?
▪	You can navigate to a specific area, down to the street and building number
o	What types of data are you working with?
▪	GDB extension database files: specifically Singapore’s Rail Lines, Tourist Stations, and Rail Stations
●	Section: Add and Symbolize the Roads layer
o	What does it mean to Select by Attributes? How does this relate to the definition of a GIS?
▪	They’re basically specific points of interest. GIS, or Geographic Information System, relies on spatial and geographic data, while this attribute feature ties a description to a geographic location. It also enables users to further tag a point of interest.
o	How do attributes relate to symbolization?
▪	Symbols are the icons that enable attributes to be seen
o	What type of a dataset is the roads layer?
▪	Streets
o	Add a screen shot of your selection.
▪	
●	Section: Find Deforestation near existing roadsThe buffer tool creates an offset at a specified distance from the input features. 
o	What is the buffer tool?
▪	A tool that creates an offset at a specified distance from the input feature.
o	How might this tool relate to UAS mission planning, or with the types of data UAS can gather?
▪	It might be useful for planning a path that circles a place of interest, and would be advantageous for when using the gimbal
o	How might UAS imagery change the detail of analysis done?
▪	Depending on the methods taken for the UAS to capture the image, the procedure can either go quickly or slowly, and depending on the gimbal angle, there can be side-shots from an aerial POV as well.
o	Provide some screen shot images of your buffers.
●	Section: Predict the impact of the proposed road.
o	What type of dataset is the Proposed road file?
▪	Four geodatabases and one raster dataset
o	When you create Proposed road feature, what type of data are you creating?
▪	Rasterized dataset
●	Section: Digitize the road
o	When you digitize in the road, are you merely drawing a line on the screen? What makes what you are creating unique? Proposed road feature, what type of data are you creating?
▪	No- you’re rasterizing the image and connecting the road together by vertices. You’re creating an attribute.
o	Provide a screen shot of your digitized road
●	Section: Finish and Print the map
o	What elements did you add to your layout to turn this image/drawing into a true map?
▪	Title and Legend
o	Why is an inset map important? How are these useful for the geographically large-scale (high detail/small) area data sets that are produced by UAS?
▪	Shows the geographic location of the area the map is focused on. Useful for reference if an individual does not know where the specific location is. 
o	Place a jpeg of your finished map in this report.

●	GIS Concepts review questions: Provide critical thought perspectives on each of the questions below. They are meant to refresh concepts learned in the Fall 309 course.
●	What makes data geospatial? That is, what makes the data you worked with today geospatial in nature (think coordinates)?
o	The data is geospatial due to the geographic spatial ties it has. As it has coordinates and is geographic information, the data itself is geospatial.
●	What makes data in a GIS different than a digital map?
o	GIS is geographic information systems. It’s not only a map - it enables geospatial data to be input and leveraged
●	Why is having an understanding of geospatial concepts and geospatial data so fundamental to working with UAS data?
o	UAS data is reliant on an understanding of geography;without a core competency of geography, someone with UASexperience is simply a pilot and not capable of effectively interpreting the information they set out to capture.
●	 What are some of the key geospatial concepts and fundamentals that this lab addresses?
o	GIS use, creating a map, interpreting databases and datasets, a high-level understanding of how to use ArcPro (and other systems assumed to be similar).
